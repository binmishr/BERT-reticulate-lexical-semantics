# BERT-reticulate-lexical-semantics

This post provides some quick details on using reticulate to interface Python from RStudio; and, more specifically, using the spacy library and BERT for fine-grained lexical semantic investigation. Here we present a (very cursory) usage-based/BERT-based perspective on the semantic distinction between further and farther, using example contexts extracted from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA).

The specific code with related to this repository is added on the .docx file as attached.
